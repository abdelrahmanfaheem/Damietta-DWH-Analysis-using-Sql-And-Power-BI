# Build and End to End ETL  solution with an ETL using SSIS and Data Analysis with Power BI

- Led the development of an end-to-end ETL solution using  SSIS to extract, transform, and load data from Excel sources into a centralized data warehouse.
- Established robust data modeling and schema design practices in SQL to create a scalable and efficient data warehouse architecture.
- Implemented comprehensive ETL processes within SSIS, including data cleansing, transformation, and loading tasks, ensuring data integrity and quality throughout the pipeline.
- Conducted in-depth data analysis using SQL queries to uncover insights, identify patterns, and perform ad-hoc analysis on the integrated data.
- Utilized Power BI to design and develop an interactive dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) and provides actionable insights derived from the consolidated data.
